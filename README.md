## Database Schema

The system uses the following main tables:
- `Users` - User accounts and roles
### Password storage (migration)

Add a `password_hash` column to the `Users` table for secure password storage using bcrypt.

Run this SQL in your Ticketly database:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Users
ADD password_hash NVARCHAR(255) NULL;

-- Optional: if all existing users will be assigned passwords now,
-- you can enforce NOT NULL afterwards
-- ALTER TABLE Users ALTER COLUMN password_hash NVARCHAR(255) NOT NULL;
```

Notes:
- New registrations will write to `Users.password_hash`.
- Logins verify the submitted password against the stored bcrypt hash.
- Do not store plaintext passwords.

- `Tickets` - Support tickets and metadata
- `Updates` - Ticket comments and status updates
- `Category`, `Priority`, `Status`, `Role` - Lookup tables
